# Laws of Form - ChatGPT Corpus

Easily prove statements and philosophize concepts of form with **George Spencer Brown's Laws of Form**, using OpenAI's ChatGPT.

In the file `Lof Starting Corpus.md` the whole corpus of Brown's Calculus of Indication is defined, and can be easily copy-pasted into ChatGPT, for inquiry and reasoning.

Works in both GPT3 and GPT4. GPT3 seems to provide more accurate answrs, while GPT4 is definitely more creative and out-of-the-box thinking.

## Usage

Copy-Paste-Enter (CPE) the corpus into ChatGPT, then get creative, asking things like:

```
Prove C4
```

```
Simplify ((a)a)(((a)ab)b)
```

```
Think of a creative and novel consequence 10 (C10), which isn't directly equivalent to the other consequences, but deserves to be a consequence on its own.
```

```
What's the philosophical meaning of echelon (C7)
```

```
How could we capture bayes rule in LoF, given the proposed model of capturing logic within LoF?
```

```
Let's get creative and think of a new operator D(a, b), which would divide a distinction a, into b equal parts. Get creative in notation, and how this would look like, and let's go beyond the two-valued nature of the laws of form
```

> Remember to be creative, open-minded, and get on exploring, and enrich the world of form with your being!
